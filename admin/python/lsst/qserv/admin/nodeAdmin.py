Module defining NodeAdmin class and related methods.

NodeAdmin is a primary interface for qserv node administration. Currently
NodeAdmin is a factory for WmgrClient instances which hides complexity
of configuring WmgrClient from various sources (CSS or anything else).
There may be additional methods added to this class in the future.

NodeAdmin uses information about worker nodes defined in Qserv CSS, for
details see https://dev.lsstcorp.org/trac/wiki/db/Qserv/CSS#Node-related.
For testing purposes it it also possible to provide worker information as
a set of parameters to constructor.
